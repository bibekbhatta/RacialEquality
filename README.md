Data credit: GABRIEL PREDA  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/bbc-news downloaded by me on 10/Apr/2023.

The initial data above contained 15643 rows; out of these, I provide herewith a list of titles/descriptions of BBC containing the following words: 
'white'  
'black'  
'asian'   

in the file **BBC_titles_refined.csv** which can be downloaded. The end result contains just 148 rows.

The data is for roughly one year (i.e.Feb 2022 to March 2023)

The following words are **excluded** but I am yet to refine the code further):
All Blacks (as in sports team)  
asian nation   
asian state  
black cap  
black cats  
black friday  
black hawk  
black sea  
black smoke  
blackburn  
blackford  
blackmail  
blackmore  
blackout  
blackpool  
white house  
whitewash  
whitehead  
whitehall
